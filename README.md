Welcome to "Librarium" - my new pet project! The main idea behind this project is to provide users with a platform where they can save and organize their favorite books. With "Librarium," you have the ability to save different books and write reviews for each one, making it a personal library tailored to your reading preferences.

Key Features:

Book Saving: You can easily add books to your virtual bookshelf. Just enter the book's details, such as title, author, genre, and cover image, and it will be saved for future reference.

Book Reviews: Share your thoughts and opinions on the books you've read. Write reviews and rate them to help other users discover great reads.

Book Lists: Organize your books into different lists based on your preferences. 

User-Friendly Interface: "Librarium" offers a simple and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience as you explore and manage your book collection.
